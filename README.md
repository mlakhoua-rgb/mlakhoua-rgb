### 🤖 AI-Augmented Leadership

I orchestrate AI agents (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Perplexity) as executive productivity multipliers, achieving 75% reduction in technical review time while maintaining human ownership of production environments. This isn't about AI replacing humans—it's about leaders using AI to scale their impact across global teams.
